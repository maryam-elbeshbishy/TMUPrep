It is a truly different kind of course. Other courses are concerned with a narrower, more specialized body of knowledge, and as a result are highly structured. Some provide quantitative techniques while others relate to specific skills. The problems and issues of strategy management cover the whole spectrum of business. Weighing the pros and cons of strategy requires a total enterprise perspective and a talent for judging how all of the relevant facts add up. To keep the discussions down to earth, each week real companies will be examined. In addition, the course uses some experiential exercises which may include a simulation. This course is by far the most demanding course in the Business Management Degree and as such it is recommended that students have 10 or fewer courses left to graduate before enrolling in this course.

'Case Experiences' is an exciting and unique course that combines students from all programs in TRSM. It responds to the growing use of business cases in learning, in opportunity identification and problem solving in business, and to the use of business cases in corporate hiring interviews. The course teaches how to systematically analyze complex and intricate issues presented by real world cases and best practices for solution presentations. The cases embody a wide range of issues, potentially including business strategy, HR and organizational governance, ethical leadership, entrepreneurship, not-for-profit organizations, marketing, retail, sales, IT, public relations, and hospitality and tourism.",

The error in making a measurement limits its usefulness. This course will introduce basic concepts associated with measurement and the uncertainty in measurement, including the source of error in measurement. Examples taken from the physical, biological and medical sciences will illustrate how the limitations of measurements can alter people's perceptions and the impact this can have on issues such as government policies and medical treatments.
